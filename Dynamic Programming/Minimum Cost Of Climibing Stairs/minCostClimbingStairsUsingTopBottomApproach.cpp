/**
 * The code has a time complexity of O(N) and space Complexity will be O(N) + O(N) = O(N).
 * This code solves the problem of finding the minimum cost to climb a set of stairs.
 * The cost to climb each step is given in the form of an array.
 * The code uses dynamic programming with a top-down approach to solve the problem.
 * It recursively calculates the minimum cost to reach each step and stores the results in a memoization table.
 * The final result is the minimum cost to reach the top from either of the last two stairs.
